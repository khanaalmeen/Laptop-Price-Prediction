# Laptop Price Prediction - Regression Project

 ## Objective 
- To build a model that helps the user to provide a tentative price of the laptop using the user's laptop configurations.
- To build a web app and deploy it on heroku.

 ## Dataset 
  Download the dataset here https://github.com/khanaalmeen/Laptop-Price-Prediction/blob/main/laptop_data.txt
  - Most of the columns in a dataset are noisy and contain lots of information. But with feature engineering we will try to get more good results. The only problem is we are having less data but we will obtain a good accuracy over it.
